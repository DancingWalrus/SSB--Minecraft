SSB - MINECRAFT : A BUKKIT PLUGIN

BukkitDev: none yet

SSB - Minecraft stands for 'Super Smash Bros - Minecraft'

This plugin is made to recreate the SMASH game, from the Shotbow Network, which can be found here: http://shotbow.net/
This is not only going to be a recreate of SMASH, but we're gonna try to make this the most accurate SSB plugin as of
yet. We do have extremely premature builds out that you should not download unless you are testing. We cannot release an
ETA on when the plugin will enter P.ALPHA, which is the version where the plugin will function decently well and where we
will put more time into bug fixing than adding more features. So, if you have suggestions, let us know! Explore the
source, in the Plugin folder, you'll see 'to-do list.txt', these are our current plans, and you are more than welcome to
add on to it.

If you're a developer and want to help us out, feel free to tell us! If you contribute to this project, you'll recieve the
Contributor perks in the game. These are exclusive particle trials, knockout sounds, and you will be given a constant
blue name tag in-game, instead of having the green/yellow/red changing nametags. You will also be given 250 Smash XP
(the currency in-game) on any server running this, but this is only at the server owner's discretion. They can configure
this one!

If you want to contribute but cannot code, do not fret! You can be a project documenter. This means that you will be
in charge of writing the plugin information on BukkitDev, and any other sites, the project is featured on, if necessary.
You will receive all of the Contributor perks.

Thanks for reading, and wish us luck,
